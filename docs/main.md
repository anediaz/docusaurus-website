# Pink flamingos

In this page I'll try out the Docusaurus multiple features.

It'll be really amusing!!

[about pink flamingos](./about.md)

By the way, look at this code
```
function getTaxonomy(props) =>
  (<div>
    <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
    <h3>Long-legged Ciconiiforme </h3>
    <h3>Ibises and spoonbills of the Threskiornithidae</h3>
   </div>
  );
```
